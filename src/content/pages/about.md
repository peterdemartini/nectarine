My name is Peter DeMartini. I am the owner of Superlative Code and I work for Octoblu. I love to create things; the more projects I have, the better.

If I am not programming, I can usually be found brewing beer, four wheeling, fishing, and spending time with friends and family. If I can find the time, I do enjoy traveling and trying new things.
